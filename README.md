WEBSITE BASES ON ONLINE EXAMINATION SYSTEM

# ABSTRACT

*The traditional method of assessment (examination) is often characterized by examination questions leakages, human errors during marking of scripts and recording of scores. The technological advancement in the field of computer science has necessitated the need for computer usage in majorly all areas of human life and endeavor’s, education sector not excluded. ExamZen is a web-based examination system where examinations are given online, either through the internet or intranet using computer system. The main goal of this online examination system is to conduct exams as online as candidates can gives exam in an examination hall and to effectively evaluate the candidates thoroughly through a fully automated system that saves a lot of time and is easy to use by faculties and candidates. ExamZen gives reliability, flexibility and robustness to examination by modern computer technology.*


# OBJECTIVE

- To provide an authenticated interface through which student can appear for online examination.
*	The questions will be picked randomly from question bank checked automatically.


# METHODOLGY

*Activities held during the research is acquiring information and knowledge about online examination system through researches that were previously done in related area. Next step taken is reading, comprehending and analyzing literature review and matching information obtained. This research emphasizes online examination system, which include usability, user-friendly interface, reliability, costing and meeting needs of target users.*

# IMPLEMENTATION

*Implementation is the second-last phase of any SDLC. It takes place after coding is performed and the system is passed through a strict testing phase and is free against any development-time error. There are many implementation approaches and based on the requirement and constraints, the best suitable tech is used.*
*For our EXAMZEN – ONLINE EXAM PORTAL, we have used ‘Direct Implementation’ approach. In this approach the old system which is being used is replaced by the new developed system. The advantage of this technique is it is very cost effective and the new system helps in various ways. As it overcome the all disadvantages of the previous system and maintain reliability.*
*This system is tested first very carefully. Then after it is being used in any organization.*


# HTML – PHP - JS – CSS - SQL
- **HTML** – HTML is used to create and save web document. It is used as a front end technology in the project.
- **PHP 5** – **Hypertext preprocessor (php)** is a technology that allows software developers to create a dynamically generated web pages, in html, Xml or other document types . It is a backend technology.
- **MySQL** – MySQL is a database, widely used for accessing querying, updating and managing data in databases.
- **CSS** – **(cascading style sheets)** create attractive layout and for affective designs.
- **JavaScript** – It is used to add dynamic and interactive elements to websites.

# LIMITATIONS & FUTURE SCOPE

*LIMITATIONS:*
- In the case of any type of problem in student verification no functionality is defined in the system to correct it or inter-communication among users are also not available.
* The Fees is taken manually as there is not any module for online payment.
+ The Total marks is get by the student only after some time of exam, because in case of subjective paper, the exam dept. will evaluate the answer and declare the result. Student can see his result on internet through his Login ID and PWD only after that.

**Note: We also need to add Faculty Tab for the faculty to access from their side rather than Admin.**

*FUTURE SCOPE:*
- Methodology of the system is clear that result in the complete and proper working of the system from the requirements achieved. It contains the working model for the development of system. A sequential step of model is followed to develop the system so that it will maintain various software engineering features/parameters.
* No need to take leave, visit a different town, city or even states in some cases. People can appear right from their laptop or home desktop.


# CONCLUSION
*This project provides a base for students to take their exam using software and allow lecturers to add questions and answers into the system. The system is developed using PHP language and data are saved in the database.*
*Online examination system for introduction to management course is the best compared to paper-based exam. The automated system helps students and lecturers to save time and makes the process faster. It saves space since answers papers will not be used. With a user friendly system that has security, integrity and the database is neither inconsistent nor redundant.*
